Just after the build deadline I pushed a massive fix that switched to using file IO streams for logs. This meant my entire logfile was compressed and encrypted, lending to faster speeds and a safer logfile overall. Unfortunately, I didn't push it fast enough and, for the build phase, was left with a logfile that concatenated individually-encrypted log entries (making it easier to corrupt the file's integrity). I've ported the stream update to the fix branch.
