Names cannot contain digits. see: https://www.builditbreakit.org/static/doc/spring2015/spec/LOGAPPEND.html
Names are alphabetic characters (a-z, A-Z) in upper and lower case.
Some examples of conditions that would result in printing "invalid" and doing nothing to the log: The name for an employee or guest, or the room ID, does not correspond to the character constraints
