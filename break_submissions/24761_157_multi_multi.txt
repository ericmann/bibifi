logappend outputs "invalid" for every line in the batch file (and does not
output any new lines).

It seems that actually, the first logfile is created by logappend.

It also seems that logread creates non-existing log files "on the fly",
but it also strips the .s from the filename - so it creates 157_multi1log
instead of reading the 157_multi.1.log which was created by logappend.
