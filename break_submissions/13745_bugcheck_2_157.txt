BREAK IT BUG REPORT #2: JUSTIFICATION ON WHY THIS IS A BUG:
BY: RAUL GARCIA
TEAM: CODE TIGERS
DATE:  5/31/14
TYPE: CORRECTNESS
CAUSE: LACK OF PROPER CHECKING OF THE LOGAPPEND PARMS
ERROR: THE -E OR -G IS MISSING WITH THEIR RESPECTIVE PARMS

JUSTIFICATION:

Basically we tell the log some guy arrives or leaves - but we forgot to say who!

The specs for the project mention for logappend:

logappend -T <timestamp> -K <token> (-E <employee-name> | -G <guest-name>) (-A | -L) [-R <room-id>] <log>

In the part: (-E <employee-name> | -G <guest-name>) we state that these are obligatory - either -E xxx or -G xxxx.

Now it is essential to check for K,T and the log file since these define a log file.

But to detect that the parm -E and -G are missing the coder has to have an internal count of the used parms
or directly verify them or have a correct regex expression. We beleive that many will not do this but just
parse the parm and their argument values. Maybe check that E/G are there but it may pass the if/else in the
case there is no match.
