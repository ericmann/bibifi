BREAK IT BUG REPORT #9: JUSTIFICATION ON WHY THIS IS A BUG:
BY: RAUL GARCIA
TEAM: CODE TIGERS
DATE:  6/2/14
TYPE: CORRECTNESS
CAUSE: LACK OF SEPARATION OF LOG FILES VS BATCH FILES, AND INVALID PASSWORDS FOR LOGREAD
ERROR: TWO LOG FILES ARE CREATED - LOG 1 AND 2. Then we issue a logappend -B for log1 after logappend for log2.
       At the end we issue logreads with incorrect passwords.

JUSTIFICATION:

The specs for the project mention for logappend:

logappend -T <timestamp> -K <token> (-E <employee-name> | -G <guest-name>) (-A | -L) [-R <room-id>] <log>
logappend -B file

The program logappend must keep separate lists of logfiles vs batch files - since these are two different entities.
The program shoud know not to allow mixing of these two which implicitly are meant for different purposes.
The batch files are never encrypted, while the log files can be encrypted.

It is essential to check for K,T and the log file since these define a log file.

Now the command logappend -B file assumes it is issued for the previous logappend and it's log file,
there is no logfile mentioned with -B, since we assume each record of the batch file will have a log file at the end.

We are telling logappend to insert the records in the (previous) log file if all is ok (password, time and same log file).

But since we created a log in step 1 we do have an existing log1 (file). Then we create log2 with another logappend.
Then we issue a logappend -B for log2 (is after logappend for log2) with the log1 as batch file - which already exists.

The program logappend should know that the current log file to append is log2. 
But we give it log1 which was created with another password (and may be encrypted).

Thus the oracle gives a double invalid - which is unexpected (one is enough?) and logappend -B should always return 0.
In futher test if pw1=pw2 we get three invalid's.

The last two checks should give integrity violation-since they are the incorrect passwords for logread.
