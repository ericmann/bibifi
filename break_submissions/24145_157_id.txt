This is a valid test case of a person (with a long name) entering the
gallery and then a room.

Both logappend calls seemingly succeed, but then the logread -S call
returns "integrity violation" and exit code 255.

The spec does not pose any limits on the length of arguments, and the length
used should be easily handleable on 32 bit systems (as other implementations
prove). If an implementation poses a smaller limit, it should be an explicit
error during logappend, and not a failure during logread.
